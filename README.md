# Star_cluster_distribution
In this repository, I provide Python tools for plotting the distribution of open and globular clusters in the sky.

After quite a bit of searching, I was not able to find a figure that would provide a clear demonstration of the differences between the distribution of open and globular clusters in the Galaxy. Therefore, I used data from the Gaia space mission to create my own plot. 

I hope this is useful to some people. Feel free to utilize the codes presented in this repository for educational purposes, presentation/outreach, and even publications. Please acknowledge, if possible. (:
 
The background image that I utilize for these figure has been produced by ESA's Gaia Collaboration with data from its second data release. You can find it in the following link: [Gaia highlights](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/highlights-of-gaia-dr2). Please acknowledge their magnificent work. For details about the this image came to be and all that it represents, see, for instance, this other link: [Gaia sky map details](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia/-/60169-gaia-s-sky-in-colour).

Overall, you can find all necessary information about the Gaia mission here: [Gaia mission](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia). Verification papers from the Gaia Collaboration are also available (from all data releases) with open access: [NASA/ADS link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=AND&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier:%220/Gaia%20Collaboration%22&fq=%7B!type=aqp%20v=$fq_author%7D&fq_author=(author_facet_hier:%220/Gaia%20Collaboration%22)&q=author:%22%5EGaia%20Collaboration%22&sort=date%20desc,%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0).
